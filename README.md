Creation of the game of Snake (Discovery of the React Framework).   

Thanks to your snake catch a maximum of apple without biting you. If you get to one edge you come out of the other. Controllable entirely on the keyboard with the arrow keys and 'z', 's', 'q', 'd'. Press the space bar to start the game and pause it.   

Have fun :grin:
